# Resolved Models

Resolved openapi models from the code-generation script.

Used to build the models and views present in [brapi_v2](../../brapi_v2).

This is only used for new BrAPI releases **only**.

Do *NOT* use these models to overwrite [brapi_v2](../../brapi_v2), specially if you don't know what you are doing.
